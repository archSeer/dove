<p>Write single page HTML documents with ease.</p>

<p>I sometimes want to quickly draft documents in something other than LaTeX. I&#39;ve realized
that in the 21<sup>st</sup> century HTML pages can easily serve that same purpose DOC, ODT and PDF
files serve. Dove enables you to write your text in Markdown, then generate beautiful web
documents.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>I was really lazy and didn&#39;t want to bother converting Markdown into HTML, then inserting
it into a HTML layout and bothering with syntax highlighting, so I&#39;ve searched for alternatives.
I&#39;ve used Jekyll before, but for writing one-page documents I don&#39;t really need a full-blown
static website solution. I then I had found <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/rocco">rocco</a>
which is a code documentation generator, and I&#39;ve used a bit of the code from it
to write Dove, a (web) document generator.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>Dove takes a Markdown file, converts it using <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">Redcarpet</a>, syntax highlights
any code snippets inside using <a href="https://github.com/jayferd/rouge">Rouge</a>, then
it takes a layout file (I use <a href="http://slim-lang.com/">Slim</a>) and uses <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt">Tilt</a>
to render it, and insert the document into the template. It also detects and
extracts any YAML frontmatter and inserts it into the layout as variables!</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Dove is meant to be used using it&#39;s binary file:</p>
<pre class="highlight text">dove document.md
</pre>
<p>Glob patterns can also be used just as easily:</p>
<pre class="highlight text">dove *.md README *.txt
</pre>
<p>But one can also require Dove inside a script, and make a new instance of it,
passing in the filename and options, then use the <code>render</code> method.</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><span class="n">dove</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Dove</span><span class="nf">.new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;document.md&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">template_file: </span><span class="s1">&#39;doc_layout.slim&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">dove</span><span class="nf">.render</span>
